# My First Portfolio

Welcome to my first web development project!

This project is part of my learning journey into front-end web development, where I'm beginning with the foundations of HTML. The goal is to understand and demonstrate how basic HTML works to structure content on a webpage.

## 🌐 Project Overview

In this project, I created a simple HTML file named `base_index.html` that includes the essential elements required for a valid webpage.

The HTML file contains:

- A `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- The `<html>` root element with a `lang` attribute
- A `<head>` section with:
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` for character encoding
  - `<title>` for the page title
- A `<body>` section with:
  - A heading
  - A paragraph

- What the **DOM (Document Object Model)** is
- The difference between **elements/tags** and **attributes**
- How web browsers **load and render web pages**

- ✅ Validated the HTML file using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- ✅ Followed best practices with semantic HTML
- ✅ Used Visual Studio Code as the recommended editor
- ✅ Included a newline at the end of the file
